# Google_HashCode_2021_Qualification
The_Project_For_Google_HashCode_2021

This is our first project in the Google Hash Code's competition.

The problem on this year competition was to produce a schedule of trafic lights 
to maximize number of vehicles go to their destinations 
in the given time constraint with description of map and vehicles' journey.

We noticed that this year challenge was quite hard compare to older editions, 
we have not experience to solve complex type of problems.

However, after some strategies by using Team management skills, with the help of Git Tools,
we able to produce solutions to put on the scoreboard.

In the end, we were in the rank 4331th global, rank 24th of Vietnamese teams.

Not only the scoreboard result, but we also achieved experiences 
for solving complex problems in the future. 

(May be in the next competition)
