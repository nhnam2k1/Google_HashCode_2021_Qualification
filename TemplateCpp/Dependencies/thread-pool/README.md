## Introduction

Multithreading is essential for modern high-performance computing. Since C++11, the C++ standard library has included built-in low-level multithreading support using constructs such as `std::thread`. However, `std::thread` creates a new thread each time it is called, which can have a significant performance overhead. Furthermore, it is possible to create more threads than the hardware can handle simultaneously, potentially resulting in a substantial slowdown.

This library contains a thread pool class, which avoids these issues by creating a fixed pool of threads once and for all, and then reusing the same threads to perform different tasks throughout the lifetime of the pool. By default, the number of threads in the pool is equal to the maximum number of threads that the hardware can run in parallel. The user submits tasks to be executed into a queue. Whenever a thread becomes available, it pops a task off the queue and executes it. If the task is a function with a return value, that value can be obtained later using an `std::future`.

In addition to `std::thread`, the C++ standard library also offers the higher-level construct `std::async`, which may internally utilize a thread pool - but this is not guaranteed, and in fact, currently only the MSVC implementation of `std::async` uses a thread pool, while GCC and Clang do not. Using a custom-made thread pool class instead of `std::async` allows the user more control, transparency, and portability.

## Basic usage

<a id="markdown-including-the-library" name="including-the-library"></a>
### Including the library

To use the thread pool library, simply include the header file:

```cpp
#include "thread_pool.hpp"
```

The thread pool will now be accessible via the `thread_pool` class.

<a id="markdown-constructors" name="constructors"></a>
### Constructors

The default constructor creates a thread pool with as many threads as the hardware can handle concurrently, as reported by the implementation via `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`. With a hyperthreaded CPU, this will be twice the number of CPU cores. This is probably the constructor you want to use. For example:

```cpp
// Constructs a thread pool with as many threads as available in the hardware.
thread_pool pool;
```

Optionally, a number of threads different from the hardware concurrency can be specified as an argument to the constructor. However, note that adding more threads than the hardware can handle will **not** improve performance, and in fact will most likely hinder it. This option exists in order to allow using **less** threads than the hardware concurrency, in cases where you wish to leave some threads available for other processes. For example:

```cpp
// Constructs a thread pool with only 12 threads.
thread_pool pool(12);
```

<a id="markdown-submitting-tasks-to-the-queue" name="submitting-tasks-to-the-queue"></a>
### Submitting tasks to the queue

A task can be any function, with zero or more arguments, and with or without a return value. Once a task has been submitted to the queue, it will be executed as soon as a thread becomes available. Tasks are executed in the order that they were submitted (first-in, first-out).

The member function `submit()` is used to submit tasks to the queue. The first argument is the function to execute, and the rest of the arguments are the arguments to pass to the function, if any. The return value is an `std::future` associated to the task. For example:

```cpp
// Submit a task without arguments to the queue, and get a future for it.
auto my_future = pool.submit(task);
// Submit a task with one argument to the queue, and get a future for it.
auto my_future = pool.submit(task, arg);
// Submit a task with two arguments to the queue, and get a future for it.
auto my_future = pool.submit(task, arg1, arg2);
```

The value of the future depends on whether the function has a return value or not:

* If the submitted function has a return value, then the future will be set to that value when the function finishes its execution.
* If the submitted function does not have a return value, then the future is a `bool` that will be set to `true` when the function finishes its execution.

To wait until the future's value becomes available, use the member function `wait()`. To obtain the value itself (and automatically wait for it if it is not yet ready), use the member function `get()`. For example:

```cpp
// Submit a task and get a future.
auto my_future = pool.submit(task);
// Do some other stuff while the task is executing.
do_stuff();
// Get the task's return value from the future.
auto my_return_value = my_future.get();
```

Please see [the C++ reference entry for `std::future`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future) for more information about using futures.

<a id="markdown-parallelizing-loops" name="parallelizing-loops"></a>
### Parallelizing loops

Consider the following loop:

```cpp
for (T i = start; i <= end; i++)
    loop(i);
```

where:

* `T` is any signed or unsigned integer type.
* `start` is the first index to loop over (inclusive).
* `end` is the last index to loop over (inclusive).
* `loop()` is a function that takes exactly one argument, the loop index, and has no return value.

This loop may be automatically parallelized and submitted to the thread pool's queue using the `parallelize_loop()` member function as follows:

```cpp
// Equivalent to the above loop, but will be automatically parallelized.
pool.parallelize_loop(start, end, loop);
```

The loop will be parallelized into a number of tasks equal to the number of threads in the pool, with each task executing the function `loop()` for a roughly equal number of indices. The calling thread will block and wait until all tasks generated by `parallelize_loop` (and only them) finish executing.

If desired, the number of parallel tasks may be manually specified using a fourth argument:

```cpp
// Parallelize the loop into 12 parallel tasks
pool.parallelize_loop(start, end, loop, 12);
```

For best performance, it is recommended to do your own benchmarks to find the optimal number of tasks for each loop. Using less tasks than there are threads may be preferred if you are also running other tasks in parallel. Using more tasks than there are threads may improve performance in some cases (see the documentation for [my multithreaded matrix class template](https://github.com/bshoshany/multithreaded-matrix) for analysis).

## Advanced usage

<a id="markdown-getting-and-resetting-the-number-of-threads-in-the-pool" name="getting-and-resetting-the-number-of-threads-in-the-pool"></a>
### Getting and resetting the number of threads in the pool

The member function `get_thread_count()` returns the number of threads in the pool. This will be equal to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` if the default constructor has been used.

It is generally unnecessary to change the number of threads in the pool after it has been created, since the whole point of a thread pool is that you only create the threads once. However, if desired, this can be done using the `reset()` member function, which waits for all submitted tasks to be completed, then destroys all threads and creates a new thread pool with the given number of threads. As for the constructor, if no argument is given, the number of threads will be the hardware concurrency.

<a id="markdown-submitting-tasks-to-the-queue-without-futures" name="submitting-tasks-to-the-queue-without-futures"></a>
### Submitting tasks to the queue without futures

Usually, it is best to submit a task to the queue using `submit()`. This allows you to wait for the task to finish and/or get its return value later. However, sometimes a future is not needed, for example when you just want to "set and forget" a certain task, or if the task already communicates with other tasks in other ways, without using futures. In such cases, you may wish to avoid the overhead involved in assigning the future to the task.

The member function `push_task()` allows you to submit a task to the queue without getting a future for it. The task can have any number of arguments, but it cannot have a return value. For example:

```cpp
// Submit a task without arguments or return value to the queue.
pool.push_task(task);
// Submit a task with one argument and no return value to the queue.
pool.push_task(task, arg);
// Submit a task with two arguments and no return value to the queue.
pool.push_task(task, arg1, arg2);
```

<a id="markdown-manually-waiting-for-all-tasks-to-complete" name="manually-waiting-for-all-tasks-to-complete"></a>
### Manually waiting for all tasks to complete

To wait for a **single** submitted task to complete, use `submit()` and then use the `wait()` or `get()` member functions of the obtained future. However, in cases where you need to wait until **all** submitted tasks finish their execution, or if the tasks have been submitted without futures using `push_task`, you may use the member function `wait_for_tasks()` of the thread pool.

Consider, for example, the following code:

```cpp
thread_pool pool;
size_t a[100];
for (size_t i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    pool.push_task([&a, i] { a[i] = i * i; });
std::cout << a[50];
```

The output will most likely be garbage, since the task that modifies `a[50]` has not yet finished executing by the time we try to access that element (in fact, that task is probably still in the queue). One solution would be to use `submit` instead of `push_task`, but perhaps we don't want the overhead of waiting for 100 different futures. Instead, simply adding the line

```cpp
pool.wait_for_tasks();
```

after the `for` loop will ensure - as efficiently as possible - that all tasks have finished running before we attempt to access any elements of the array `a`, and the code will print out `2500` as expected. (Note, however, that `wait_for_tasks()` will wait for **all** tasks in the queue, including those that are unrelated to the `for` loop. Using `parallelize_loop()` would make much more sense in this case, as it will wait only for tasks related to the loop.)

## Synchronizing printing to an output stream

<a id="markdown-motivation" name="motivation"></a>
### Motivation

When printing to an output stream from multiple threads in parallel, the output may become garbled. For example, consider this code:

```cpp
thread_pool pool;
for (auto i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    pool.push_task([i] {
        std::cout << "Task no. " << i << " executing.\n";
    });
```

The output may look as follows:

```none
Task no. Task no. 2Task no. 5 executing.
Task no.  executing.
Task no. 1 executing.
4 executing.
3 executing.
```

The reason is that, although each **individual** insertion to `std::cout` is thread-safe, there is no mechanism in place to ensure subsequent insertions from the same thread are printed contiguously.

<a id="markdown-the-synced-stream-class" name="the-synced-stream-class"></a>
### The synced stream class

The class `synced_stream` is designed to avoid such synchronization issues. The constructor takes one optional argument, specifying the output stream to print to. If no argument is supplied, `std::cout` will be used:

```cpp
// Construct a synced stream that will print to std::cout.
synced_stream sync_out;
// Construct a synced stream that will print to the output stream my_stream.
synced_stream sync_out(my_stream);
```

The member function `print()` takes an arbitrary number of arguments, which are inserted into the stream one by one, in the order they were given. `println()` does the same, but also prints a newline character `\n` at the end, for convenience. A mutex is used to synchronize this process, so that any other calls to `print()` or `println()` using the same `synced_stream` object must wait until the previous call has finished.

For example, this code:

```cpp
synced_stream sync_out;
thread_pool pool;
for (auto i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    pool.push_task([i, &sync_out] {
        sync_out.println("Task no. ", i, " executing.");
    });
```

Will print out:

```none
Task no. 1 executing.
Task no. 2 executing.
Task no. 3 executing.
Task no. 4 executing.
Task no. 5 executing.
```
